My solutions for the homework exercises of <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/">
CIS 194: Introduction to Haskell (Spring 2013)</a>.

CIS 194 is a Haskell course taught at the University of Pennsylvania. In the spring of 2013 the course was taught by
Brent Yorgey, who has also published the course material on <a href="https://github.com/byorgey/haskell-course">GitHub</a>.
In many sites of the Web the course is said to be one of the best learning materials.

I'm going through the lecture notes and doing the homework exercises to get good or at least decent understanding of
<a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>.
